My name is Lorenzo Arritola. I have held a passion for films and filmmaking since my childhood, utilizing my free time away from school to immerse myself in the world of cinema. My passion for filmmaking carried over into my college education, where I honed my abilities for production (i.e., cinematography and photography) and post-production processes (i.e., sound design, non-linear digital editing, and visual effects).
